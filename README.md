# Subreddit-Crawler
1. I created a program that allows me to type in the name of a subreddit that I'm interested in.

2. Once I enter the subreddit name, the program checks if the subreddit exists. If it does, the program goes ahead and collects data about the top 25 most popular posts of all time within that subreddit.

3. For each post, the program collects important details like the post's title, the number of people who liked it, the number of comments it received, and if there's a link to something outside of Reddit. It also finds and saves the top comment on each post, which usually gives a good idea of what people are saying about the post.

4. The program then organizes all this information into a file that I can easily open and view, like an Excel spreadsheet.

In simpler words, I've made a tool that helps me look at the most popular posts and discussions within a specific area of Reddit. It's like getting a sneak peek into what people are talking about and what they find interesting.
